Your task is simple: Just describe what you see on the screen. On each trial, you will see an unfamiliar shape; your goal should be to describe the shape so that a person could draw something similar based on your description. Your description can be any number of words you feel are necessary to accurately describe the shape. Press any key to begin.</p>"," ","","","","","","",""

You received visual stimuli of varying complexity and was asked to describe them. We are collecting data to show the relationship between complex objects and events in the real world and their representations in the mind. We want to know if there is an inverted U-shaped relationship between the two, meaning the length of the descriptions of the stimuli would increase as their complexity increases, hit a plateau point of maximum of description length where they would then begin the decrease as the stimuli gets increasingly complex still. Thanks for participating!</p>"," ","","","","","","",""
